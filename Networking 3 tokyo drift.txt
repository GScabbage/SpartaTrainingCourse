The network layer, layer 3

a router is a networking device that forwards (routes) the traffic between computer networks

Switch 					Vs 			Router
forwards traffic based on destination MAC address		forwards traffic based on IP address
pass broadcast frames to all ports (except recieving one)	doesn't forward any broadcast frames
one broadcast domain						splits the broadcast domain into multiple broadcast domains
connects PCs that share the same newtork id			connect networks that have different network id
forward traffic between networks that are connected		can connect networks that are connect using different technology
using the same data-link standard (e.g. Ethernet)		e.g. Ethernet, ADSL, Broadband, etc

the Default Gateway
It's the router interface that is connected on a network reachable from the host
it's the IP address of the NIC of a router
a host uses it in case it wants to send data to another host in a different network
it should be directly connected on the same network of the hosts
the IP address of a default gateway should have the same NetID of the hosts
a host send the traffic to the router when it finds out that the destination IP address isn't on its network

Small Network Routing
the most simple router is a computer that has two network interface cards at least
