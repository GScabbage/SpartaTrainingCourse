Linux Architecture
Imagine a many layer circle, like those drawings of the earths core
The core is hardware
The lower mantle is the Kernel
The Upper mantle is the shell
The crust is the applications and utilities 
In the void above it is you the user

The shell is the interface between the user, applications and utilities and the kernel

Linux has many distributions, each one focuses on a different purpose. 
For example Ubuntu is for normal use while Kali is mainly for cyber security purposes

Linux mainly uses EXT4 for its file system

With Linux everything starts at the root instead of with a letter like c,d,e
Linux use the everything is a file, everything you use is treated as a file
Commands, file names and directories are case sensitive
Hidden files/directories start with a "."

The Linux shell aka the command line, terminal
can be accessed via activities by typing in shell/terminal
or by ctrl-alt-T
