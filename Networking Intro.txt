Network Components

Hosts - anything connected to the network
Peer-to-peer - the connected machines can provide a service or use a service, such as using a printer
Intermediary Device - devices that interconnect end devices like a wifi router
Network Media - The communications channels used to interconnect nodes on a computer network like cables, radio waves

Network Infrastructure
LAN - Local Area Network, a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as school or office block
WAN - Wide Area Network, a network of interconnected LAN's such as a broadband provider

Intranet - a computer network for sharing tools, operational systems and computer services within an organisation which excludes
	   access to outsiders
Extranet - a controlled private network
Internet -

Communications Fundamentals
Message Source - People or electronic device that needs to send a message to another individual or device
Message Destination - this recieves the message and interprets it
Channel - The media with which provides the pathway for the message to travel from its source to destination

Message Delivery Options
Unicast - Information is being transmitted to a single end device
Multicast - Information is being transmitted to one or more end devices
Broadcast - Information is being transmitted to all end devices

Protocol Suites
ISO Suite
Physical Layer - Is responsible for sending bits between devices
Data Link Layer - decides and controls how the data will be transmitted from the physical layer, handles bit transmission
		  erros and controls the flow of data
Network Layer - 
Transport Layer - the actual data transporting process, TCP - Transmission Control Protocol, UDP - User Datagram Protocol
                  TCP ensure all the data is recieved, is more time consuming but is needed if all data must be recieved such as an email
		  UDP can detect corrupt or lost data packets but doesnt stop it, is much faster but less reliable so useful for
		  things like streaming or video chats as data can be repeated and you likely wont notice missing data
Session Layer -
Presentation Layer -
Application Layer -

TCP/IP Protocol Suite


Port Numbers
TCP and UDP use port numbers to manage multiple, simultaneous conversations
Destination port number is assoctated with the destination application on the server host
Source port number is associated with the originating application on the user's host
A server can offer more than one service simultaneously such as
SSH service on port 22
Web services on port 80
FTP establishment on port 21
Source port number acts as a return address for the requesting application

Port Number Groups
Well-known Ports - 0 to 1,023 - Reserved for common or popular services and applications such as web browsers, email clients and remote access clients
Registered Ports - 1024 to 49151 - Assigned by IANA to a requesting entity to use with specific processes or applications
Private and/or Dynamics ports - 49152 to 65535 - These port are known as ephemeral ports, the client's OS usually assign port numbers
						 dynamically when a connection to a service is initiated
