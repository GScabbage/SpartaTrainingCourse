Cyber Security Essentials

Cyber Security Definitions:
NIST: the ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attack

CNSS: Prevention of damage to and the protection of and the restoration of computers,
 electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communications
and electronic communication including information contained therin
to ensure its availability,intergrity,authentication,confidentiality and non-repudiation

Area 1 - Desired Goals
	Confidentiality
	Integrity
	Availability
Area 2 - Data States
	Transmission
	Storages
	Processing
Area 3 - Safeguards
	Human Factors
	Policy and Practices
	Technology

Confidentiality - Prevention of unauthorized access
Integrity - Ensuring the data is in its correct state
Availability - Ensuring those authorized have easy access to the data

Storage - Data At Rest (DAR) this is that data in the system currently being stored in 
	  disks or magnetic tape
Transmission - Data In Transit (DIT) data moving between information systems
Processing - Do operations on the data to achieve an objective

Policy and Practices - Administrative controls/operations of the information system
Human Factors - Personnel methods to protect the data like training to use the technology
		and the policy for the system
Technology - Software and Hardware solutions to protect the information system

Essential Terms
Asset - What is being protected
Vulnerability - Weakness or gap in the protection effort
Exploit - How the vulnerability is leveraged by hackers
Threat - What is trying to be protected against
Risk - Where the asset, threats and vulnerabilities combine

Vulnerabilities
1. Design and development errors
2. Poor system configuration
3. Human erros - send access to the system accidentally, responding to phishing attempts
4. Connectivity - unsecure networks
5. Complexity - the more things a system can do the more likely an accidental vulnerability can form
6. Passwords - systems allowing weak passwords are vulnerable yet should require too much
7. User Input - limit what can be input so dangerous code can't be easily added to the system
8. Management
9. Lack of training
10. Communication

Types of Cyber attack

1. Un-targeted cyber attacks - like phishing emails, just trying to get anyone to click the link
2. Tarfeted attack - spear-phishing, want a specific person or group of people to access a link or similar to give specific
		     access to a network or target

Cyber threat actors

Nation states - Geopolitical
Cybercriminals - Profit
Hacktivists - Ideology
Terrorist Groups - Ideological violence
Thrill Seekers - Cause why not
Insider Threats - Discontent

Cyber Threats

Malware - Software that does a malicious or unwanted task on a device or network, not necessarily directly harmful
Spyware - Subsection of malware that hides on the device to provide real time information
Physhing attacks - Cybercriminals attempt to lure individuals to giving away sensitive data usually through impersonation
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack - designed to flood a network with requests to cause it to overload or crash
Ransomware - Another subsection of malware that denies access to a computer, network or data until a ransom is paid
Zero-day Explot - A flaw in software, hardware or firmware that is unkown to those responsible to patching the flaws
Advanced Persistent threats - When an unwanted user gains access to a system then remains undetected for a long period of time
Trojan - Uses a backdoor to get into your system
Wiper attacks - Malware subsection thats goal is to wipe your hard drive
Intellectual property theft - stealing or using someones else's IP without permission
Money Theft - Gaining access to bank accounts or credits cards to steal money or purchase unwanted items for the theif
Data manipulation - infiltrating a system to modify or add to existing data instead of taking it
Data destruction - attacking a system to destroy data
Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) - attack the information during communication between two parties
Drive-by downloads - Downloads that happen without the user being aware, such as when you get to a website or open an email
Rogue Software - a subsection of malware where legitimate software is being used as a disguise for malware
Unpatched software - software with known security weaknessess that have yet to be fixed
Data centre disruption due to natural disasters - location of data storage damaged via external means like flooding
Water holing - exploiting user by using a fake website or compromising a genuine one
Spear-phishing - sending emails to targeted individuals with malicious software or links to malicious software
Deploying a botnet - used to deliver DDOS attacks
Subverting the supply chain - attack equipment or software being delivered to an organisation
