NIC - Network Interface Controller
NIC to NIC communications within the same network
Prepares network data for the physical network
Ethernet is only one type of protocols/devices used in LAN
That data link layer prepares network for the physical network

Ethernet is the most common type of LAN
It has multiple connection modes
Half-Duplex mode: it either sends or recieves data, but can't do both
Full-Duplex mode: it can send and recieve at the same time

Ethernet types-
Ethernet 10Mbps half-duplex
FastEthernet 100Mbps half-duplex/full-duplex (the standard on modern PCs)
1 Gigabit Ethernet 1Gbps half-duplex/full-duplex
10 Gigabit Ethernet 10Gbps full-duplex (used by most servers)

Switch
a switch is made up of integrated circuits and the accompanying software that controls that data paths through the switch
a switch is composed of several ports. each port is used to connect to an end device or to another intermediary device
forward the traffic (based on the destination MAC address) recieved on a port to another port where the destination is connected
switch uses its source mac address to build its own knowledge base to forward traffic to the correct mac address, if it doesnt
know then it will send the packet out of all ports except the one it was recieved on

Data-link encapsulation
It gets the network header from layer 3, which contains the source IP and the destination IP
the Data-link header in layer 2 has the source MAC address and destination MAC address
to get the destination MAC the Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) is used

ARP is the layer 2 protocol that is used to find the MAC address of the NIC(on the same network) that has a certain IP address
ARP mechanism:
if you need the MAC of an IP address, broadcast on your network
all devices on your network will recieve the broadcast request
only the concerned device (i.e. the NIC with that IP) will reply
