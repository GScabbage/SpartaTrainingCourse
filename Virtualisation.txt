Virtualisation - is the process of seperating software from hardware
Virtual Server - the server has no physical form just a virtual format
Hypervisor - aka Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) is an interface between the Virtual Machine and the host

Traditional Architecture:
Applications
Operating System
Physical node

Virtual Architecture:
Many Applications
Many operating systems
Virtualization Layer "Hypervisor"
Physical Node

Types of Virtualisation

Type 1:
No underlying OS on the hardware, hypervisor is running directly on the host machine
Single security layer provided by hypervisor
Examples - Xen, Microsoft Hyper V, VMware ESX/ESXi

Type 2:
Does use an underlying OS like Microsoft Windows or Linux, 
this way the hypervisor is just another software on the OS and shares its resources like any other app on an OS
Two security layers provided by the hypervisor and the host OS
Examples - VMware Workstation, VMware Player, VirtualBox

Type 1 has better security, despite having only 1 layer it has much less running for vulnerabilities in the first place
Type 1 has better performance it is running directly on the host machine and doesnt have to share with the real machine
